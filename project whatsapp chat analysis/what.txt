Hope this email finds you well. As you must be aware that given the current uncertainty caused by COVID-19 in the in-office hiring process, the best way to find fresh talent right now is by hiring work from home interns. launching the Challo Exposys Data Labs Lets Work From Home campaign on  2 July 2022 which will exclusively feature work from home internships across all profiles.

About the campaign: Since students across India have had their in-office internships either deferred or canceled, they are now actively seeking opportunities to work from home. This campaign aims at virtually connecting the best talent of the country with companies offering such opportunities.

What’s in it for you? This campaign will be promoted among 3 million+ students across India and thus, you are likely to get more internship visibility and applications than usual. Along with this, you can avail our ‘invite candidates’ and ‘online chat’ feature for a smooth hiring and onboarding process.

So, if you have any internship requirements for a duration of 1 week - 6 months,

1) It is being observed that many of the students are coming late to the college which will not be entertained from tomorrow and those students will be liable for the due procedure as suggested by the discipline committee however students with genuine reason and prior permission form the respective mentor may be considered i.e in exceptional cases only.

2) With regard to the dressing uniform for B.tech 1st years ,2nd and 3rd year students must wear formal dress and do the inshirt properly.

3) Have a properly groomed hair of moderate length and style and a clean shave.

After all, your co-operation is highly appreciated and do follow as suggested with immediate effect.

Thank You.

To get LEARNATHON 2022 certification one has to complete at least 5 courses out of 9. 


To start their learning process individual registration for each course is required. 


I am sharing Each Course MS-word files in which step by step procedure is given to assist the students to get registered and to complete that particular course.
